# What is shell?

Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. 


On most Linux systems a program called bash (standards for Bourne Again Shell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, `sh`, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. 


Shell is a command line interface, a user interface to access to an operating system's services. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
